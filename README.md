# Observability Prometheus

This repository contains a simple Go application that exposes metrics for Prometheus to scrape. It uses the prometheus/client_golang package to create and manage these metrics. The application simulates user activity and HTTP request handling, providing a realistic example of how to instrument a web service with Prometheus.
